### Hi, Iâ€™m Lenny (aka Lezurex)

Iâ€™m a software developer from Zurich ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, passionate about clean, practical solutions. My focus is on building APIs an web applications, but I enjoy exploring different technologies as needed.

Please also take a look at my [Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/Lezurex). New projects of mine will only be developed over there as I don't want to rely on a US-based service.
